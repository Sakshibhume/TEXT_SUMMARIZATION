2.#DEMO SECTION:
Demo
The text summarization tool takes in a block of text and applies natural language processing techniques to condense it into a shorter version that preserves the main points and essential information. It supports various summarization methods, including extractive and abstractive summarization.

Extractive Summarization: This method identifies key sentences and phrases from the original text, selecting them to form a summary. It works by scoring sentences based on their relevance, then combining the highest-scoring sentences into a concise summary.

Abstractive Summarization (if applicable): This approach rephrases and re-generates the content, creating new sentences that capture the meaning of the original text rather than merely selecting key phrases. Abstractive summarization uses deep learning models to understand the content and create human-like summaries.

To use the tool:

Enter the text you want to summarize in the provided input area.
Choose the desired summarization length (e.g., short, medium, or long).
Click "Summarize" to generate the summary.
The summary will appear below, with options to copy or save it as needed. If using the command line, simply run:

python summarize.py --text "Your input text here"
This approach ensures you receive a concise, meaningful summary, ideal for quickly grasping large volumes of information.
